        <h3><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h3>
        <h4>In the 1990s a global political consensus emerged that "women's
rights" are also "human rights." In particular, the Beijing
Women's Conference set forth an ambitious agenda, and activistscholars
in the global South began circulating ideas and papers
on "putting women in the centre of analysis." I believe this focus
is necessary, especially when it comes to critiquing the current
prison system worldwide. Globalization has altered family
relations and consumer behaviours, further marginalizing
women in caste and class societies. There has been little research
done on the impact of globalization on incarcerated women
in Africa, with perhaps the notable exception of sex work and
trafficking of girls and women from West Africa. This chapter
offers a comparative approach to issues faced by criminalized
and imprisoned women in several African countries. It also
highlights the voices of resistance, especially women political
prisoners of South Africa.</h4>

        <h3><b>AFRICAN WOMEN AND THE GLOBAL HUMAN
RIGHTS AGENDA</b></h3>
        <h4>When feminists in the global North talk about women's rights in
Africa, inevitably the first thing that comes to mind is the topic of female circumcision or, in feminist-charged speak, female
genital mutilation.1
 This discussion may be followed by other
discussions of sexualized violence, such as trafficking, AIDS,
and, occasionally, customary practices such as polygamy and
land tenure. On the bright side, the UN Millennium Goals have
broader and more explicit gender perspectives affecting women
in Africa, including economic and educational rights. Yet,
overall, despite the important shift of the human rights agenda
to do more than lip service to women's rights, African women
get short shrift.
Feminist writer and educator Abena Busia tries to shift
the discourse about women in Africa through a new academic
endeavour, Women Writing Africa, sponsored by Rutgers
University. She shares the following insight in an interview with
WHR.net: In Women Writing Africa we collect women's cultural
production—oral and written, formal and informal, sacred and
profane. We try to collect whatever we can lay our hands on, as
far back as we can get. We are looking at things that we know
were written or spoken in female-centered spaces, about things
that only women could say or in circumstances that women
can control. What we are trying to do is get a sense of the way
women have agency and control over their lives and negotiate
their lives differently.
We just got so tired of our non-existence as women of power
and agency in Western discourse where we are predominantly
viewed as perpetual victims —a barefoot pregnant woman
holding a baby in our hands, or a barefoot pregnant woman
with a baby on our back and hoe in our hand. We are labeled
endlessly. That sense of missing many things —such as no
agency, no affective space, no human negotiation—all those
things, which in fact, everybody knows are profoundly central
to our existence and shape our lives. (WHR.net 2003; emphasis
added). Given the colonizing lens that Busia describes so well, the
outsider expert continues to label and exoticize the hapless
African woman, and knows which remedies work best for
African women and children (Mohanty 1990; Nagel 2001). This
patronizing " speaking for" attitude has come under criticism, in
particular with respect to vociferous attacks on female genital
mutilation by non-African feminists (Butegwa 2002; Welch
1995).
In the decade of emerging women's rights, which culminated
in the Beijing Women's Conference, it turned out that the
African regional committee provided much food for thought for
the conference. The final platform for action drew much of its
content from the preparatory African meetings. No longer would
African women be silent bystanders who have to be represented
by "well-meaning" northerners; rather, under the leadership of
Gertrude Mongella, dubbed in Africa as "Mama Beijing," they
have joined the centre of discussions and shaped the platform
for women decisively.

   <h3><b>AFRICAN HUMAN RIGHTS DISCOURSE</b></h3>
   <h4>In recent years several conferences and books have been devoted
to the question of human rights in Africa. Does it make sense to
focus on a "rights discourse/' or is it more prudent to use "other
languages of resistance" (An-Na'im 2002)? The human rights
declarations that evolved from the global North focus almost
exclusively on the negative rights of the individual against state
power: from the British and American Bills of Rights to the
Universal Declarations of Human Rights, these documents focus
on individualized freedom to pursue self-interested ideals apart
from community needs. Such ideology is alien (and therefore not
universalizable) to most of the globe, where community interests
trump individual interests, especially the possessive individual
pursuit of happiness. Thus, John Mbiti (1970, 141) rearticulates
the egocentric Cartesian cogito into a sociocentric variant: "I am
because we are, and because we are therefore I am." Clearly,
a Eurocentric "rights discourse" devoid of sensitivity toward
cultural practices will not be applicable in an African context of
sociality and responsibility toward one's community, customs,
and elders. However, due to the colonial legacy, the rights
discourse has firmly been instituted in the legal instruments of
African countries.
The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (1986)
weaves together different traditions, and the outcome has
been assailed as a contradictory mix of rights and duties of the
individual and groups (Mutua 2002). However, as Makau Mutua
emphasizes, Western human rights experts have underestimated
the reality of individual rights of Africans before colonial conquest.
Mutua's cursory view of precolonial practices of adjudication
highlights the high respect for human life and the dignity of
the person, the guarantee of equal protection of individuals
(e.g., the Akamba of East Africa), the ability to dismiss a chief
who rules oppressively (in the Akan society of West Africa),the presumption of innocence, and dedication to the juridical
process (e.g., the Amhara of East Africa). Mutua is careful not
to romanticize the historical record of precolonial Africa and
points to cases where human rights of individuals, especially the
rights of women, were not safeguarded. So in what ways can
individual and group rights coexist in harmony, as the African
charter imagines? The new South African Constitution (1994)
also commits itself to this ideal of coexistence. However, the past
decade witnessed serious tensions, particularly in customary
family law (Chanock 2002). In 2005 the South African Supreme
Court ended some aspects of the debate by ruling that customs
that discriminate on the basis of gender have to be abolished. The
debate is still going on in the northern states of Nigeria, which
ushered in sharia law in 2000

   <h3><b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF PRISONS IN AFRICA</b></h3>
   <h4>Prisons in Africa are an un-African institution. In precolonial
African societies one of the harshest sentences faced by an
offender was expulsion; exile equated to social death. When the
European colonialists arrived, in the " scramble for Africa/' they
converted slave forts along the Atlantic coast into jails or cachots
(Bernault 2003). Chinua Achebe's (1954) anti-colonial novel
Things Fall Apart describes well the trauma incurred by political
leaders of the community who faced incarceration by the colonial
power. For the African psyche it was simply unimaginable to
utilize prisons as a form of punishment. West Africa's measures
for crime control tended to be restorative and retributive justice;
collective punishment, rather than individual punishment,
was also common. Where an individual defrauded a member
of another clan the offender's entire clan may have had to pay
restitution, as is still commonly practised in Mali (Kone 2003).
During colonial times sexual assault and gang rape were
particularly prevalent because women were not given separate
quarters from men in prison. In Senegal African women were
expected to cook for the entire prison population and sleep
in the kitchen or on the porch of the fort or prison compound
(Konate 2003). Colonial prisons enforced racial segregation, and
European prisoners were housed in the vicinity of the warden's
office or compound (Goerg 2003).
In postcolonial Africa several notorious prisons were shut
down, and some serve as memorials for a haunted past, such
as Robben Island, where South Africa's anti-apartheid activists
were imprisoned. Due to the international pressures of the
United Nations and human rights organizations, a few countrieshave opened separate prisons for women and adolescent men.
However, most African prisons house men, women, and children,
and may merely provide separate sleeping quarters for men and
women.

   <h3><b>GENERAL ISSUES OF WOMEN'S HUMAN RIGHTS
BEHIND CUSTOMARY WALLS OR PRISON WALLS</b></h3>
   <h4>Even in Africa, prisons have turned into "homes" for young,
socially displaced, undereducated, and poor women, many of
whom are also mothers. Social displacement is an effect in part
of globalization and structural adjustment. More single women
leave their rural homes and venture into the cities for gainful
employment. Unlike their male counterparts, female convicts'crimes tend to be non-violent, such as theft. Certain occupations,
such as sex work or domestic work and, to a lesser extent,
drug-dealing, expose women to a higher risk of sexual abuse
and criminalization. Domestic workers tend to be young, rural,
unmarried women who may risk being assaulted or raped by
their patrons, and in countries where abortion is illegal they may
commit infanticide out of despair. In some women's prisons,
such as in Bamako, Mali, the majority of prisoners and remanded
women are accused — or convicted — of infanticide. Mali does not
sanction legal medical procedures for the abortion of an unwanted
child. The social sanctions of having a child out of wedlock are
severe. Unfair and sexist trial procedures put women at further
risk. A divorced woman whose baby was stillborn was charged
with murder because her doctor's evidence was not introduced
in court (Amnesty International 2004).
In several African countries the familial practice of polygamy
seems to be an additional stress factor, but it affects more women
who have never received formal education and those who
dropped out of primary education. Polygamy seems to be losing
widespread support due to westernization, urbanization, and
Christianity. A recent Ugandan study (Tibatemwa-Ekirikubinza
1999) actually notes the higher prevalence of female criminality
(targeting the husband, junior co-wife, or the co-wife's child) in
rural regions where polygamy is prevalent. Prisoners, in particular
those who were senior wives, note the disparities in asset-sharing
by their husbands; many times these convicts rationalize their
violent offences by accusing the husband of total economic and
emotional abandonment of the senior wife and her children,
and devoting all the jointly earned resources to the new co-wife
(Tibatemwa-Ekirikubinza 1999). The majority of women who are
convicted of violent crimes have been in abusive relationships
(see Walker 1984 on battered woman syndrome), and it is only
since the UN conference in Beijing (1996) that domestic violence
has been taken seriously as a public health concern.4
 Yet women
who kill their abusive partners in self-defence or in premeditation
receive punitive sentences, including capital punishment, rather
than leniency and compassion.

   <h3><b>CONCLUSION</b></h3>
   <h4>This chapter has discussed in broad strokes human rights issues
of African women, in particular those who are " walled in" by
"culture" or by "criminal law" statutes. Let me return to the unAfrican
custom of incarceration by the state.
Without question, women who enter the criminal justice
system have experienced serious victimization prior to arrest and
incarceration. While the reasons for their incarceration may be
country-specific, victimization coupled with poverty comprises
a major factor in pushing a woman into a difficult situation. It is
then quite easy to argue for more lenient sentences for women
victims-turned-perpetrators. One can argue that women should
not face incarceration because it aggravates their already poor
social status and gives them fewer choices when they return
to civil society. Furthermore, the sentence often disconnects a
mother from her children, who in turn are likely to become felons
and prisoners too. However, it is quite another matter to argue for
leniency toward other perpetrators, say men. Nevertheless, this
is what some feminist prison activists are prepared to do. From
the classic Instead of Prisons (Knopp et al. 1976) to the manifesto
Prisons and Social Control (Kinesis 1987) activists have argued for
the abolition of the criminal justice system, in particular curtailing
the sentencing of people to prisons and making them into "slaves
of the state" (Muntaquim 2003; Nagel 2003).
Human rights are safeguarded only when people are indeed
treated with humanity, and 200 years of the experiment of caging
people have shown us that prisons not only are "crime schools"but also prepare people for savagery and despair, not penitence
and rehabilitation. Minimum standards for prisoners ought to be
guaranteed, but this should not be the end of one's advocacy. It is
merely the starting point of acknowledging that nobody forfeits
rights, not even a prisoner on death row, and much more has to
be done to encourage prison reform and eventual abolition.
